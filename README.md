# JobAnalysis
# This project aims to find a correlation between job descriptions, skills and job title.

We will focus on the following jobs: Data Scientist- Data Analyst - Data Engineer - Business Analyst - Business Intelligence

The job dataset was extracted from an [spreadsheet file](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xWtdPaEmi6Voaum_3Ruv-Ise0SKaxVSrs5G2a0V8PLA/edit#gid=0), which contains job posting mined from different job boards and social network posts in Vietnam.

The dataset was processed manually using Excel, but there are still inconsistencies.

This dataset contains 3188 job postings, which originally contains 9 columns and was aggregated into 34 columns. Job descriptions were translated by Google, with minor manual editing.

**Important: Job category columns were manually labelled based on Job Title**
